# Trivia_Smackdown

This is a two player Python trivia game that is played in the terminal of your preferred IDE. Users can pick between four categories and easy or hard questions. The categories are Marvel, History, Disney World, and Pop Culture. 
Once the users pick their category and difficulty level, they will play through five questions. Once they finish the last question, they can choose to keep playing or quit. If the users choose to quit, they will see their score at the end and who the winner is. If the users choose to continue, they will be prompted to pick another category and difficulty level of questions. The Trivia-V10.py file is the file that contains the trivia game.
