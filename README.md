# Trivia_Smackdown

This is a two-player Python trivia game played in the terminal. Each player chooses from four categories (Marvel, History, Disney World, Pop Culture) and an easy or hard difficulty, then answers five questions per round. After each round, players can choose to continue with a new category/difficulty or quit and see their final scores and the winner. 

To play the game, run the `Trivia-V10.py` file.
